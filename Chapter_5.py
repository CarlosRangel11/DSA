# The Hiring Problem
# We use an employment agency to send a candidate
# each day for a small fee to interview an applicatant. 
# To hire the applicant is more costly, as you must fire the 
# current employee in that position & pay a large hiring fee
# to the employment agency. 

# We are committed to having the best person for the job at all times, 
# so if we received an applicant better qualified for a job, we would
# fire the current employee & hire that one ON THE SPOT. It is our
# job to figure out what the price of this strategy would be. 

# Class to explore FILEIO in python.

# have gotten interviewed!
# 
# This is (sum(1, n, 1/n)), which is the harmonic series = ln(n) * Î“, where
# Gamma is the Euler-Mascheroni Constant. 
# In our case, however, we are looking to multiply the cost of hiring + cost of
# interviewing.
